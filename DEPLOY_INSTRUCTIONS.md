# Deploy konkokt.xyz Update

Your app is built and ready to deploy to konkokt.xyz

## Quick Deploy Options:

### Option 1: Netlify Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Find your "konkokt" site
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Drag and drop the `dist` folder OR the `konkokt-deploy.zip` file
5. Done!

### Option 2: Netlify CLI
If you have the Netlify CLI set up:
```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Netlify (Site settings → Environment variables):
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
- VITE_XAI_API_KEY
- VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY

(They should already be set from the previous deployment)

## What's Fixed:
